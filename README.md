# ACD_FEB2.1_Session_2_Assignment_4_Main

Yesterday I submitted five assignments and I recieved following feedback :
"Great you have followed the second session assignments with ease. However small feedback is you need to make sure that the screenshot of the output and doc type comments need to be given whenever you are submitting your code to us."

I am uploading output screenshot picture with this assignment.

But Its not clear for me what do you mean by "DOC TYPE COMMENTS". Please explain or you can mail me example on my email id.
